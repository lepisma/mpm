#+TITLE: mpm

~mpm~ is a package manager for music. It tries to solve two problems:

1. Limitations of keeping local music files.
2. Lack of decent exploratory music search on vanilla internet.

It is planned to consists of following components:
+ /Resolvers/ which resolve ~sources~ to real files. This can be local files (via
  beets) or streaming files, e.g. via a YouTube cache. The end product of
  resolution is an updated database of songs with pointer to appropriate
  file/url.
+ A set of /plugins/ which add features, create groups etc. in the database by
  following the pointers.
+ A /search/ system for creating rule based lists for playback, possibly allowing
  other players to use the lists.
