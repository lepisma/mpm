#+TITLE: mpm

~mpm~ is a package manager for music. It tries to solve two problems:

1. Limitations of keeping local music files.
2. Lack of decent exploratory music search on vanilla internet.

It is planned to consist of following components:
+ /Resolvers/ which resolve ~sources~ to real files. These can be local files (from
  beets database) or streaming files, e.g. via youtube. The end product of
  resolution is an updated database of songs with pointer to appropriate
  file/url.
+ A set of /plugins/ which add features, create groups, add custom sources (like
  hot 100, recommendations based on my last few listens) etc. in the database by
  working on the the pointers.
+ A /search/ system for creating dynamic, rule based lists (initially based on
  beets-bbq) for playback, possibly allowing other players to use these lists.
