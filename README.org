#+TITLE: mpm

~mpm~ is a package manager for music. It tries to solve two problems:

1. Limitations of keeping local music files.
2. Lack of decent exploratory music search on vanilla internet.

It is planned to consist of following components:
+ /Resolvers/ which resolve ~sources~ to playable links. These /mpm/ links can be
  local files (from beets database ~beets:<song-id>~) or streaming files, e.g. via
  youtube (~yt:d_xEVzTDN3c~). The end product of resolution is an updated database
  of saved songs with pointer to appropriate file/url.
+ A set of /plugins/ which add features, create groups, add custom sources (like
  hot 100, recommendations based on my last few listens) etc. in the database by
  working on the pointers.
+ [[https://github.com/lepisma/bbq][bbq]] for creating dynamic, rule based lists for playback.
+ [[https://github.com/lepisma/mpm-play][mpm-play]] for playing mpm links.
