#+TITLE: mpm

~mpm~ is a package manager for music. It is planned to consist of following
components:

+ /Resolvers/ which resolve ~sources~ to playable links. These /mpm/ links can be
  local files (from beets database ~beets:<song-id>~) or streaming files, e.g. via
  youtube (~yt:d_xEVzTDN3c~). The end product of resolution is an updated database
  of saved songs with pointer to appropriate file/url.
+ [[https://github.com/lepisma/mpm-play][mpm-play]] for playing mpm links.
+ [[https://github.com/lepisma/bbq][bbq]] for building playlists.

There are two places for feature addition:

+ Sources for saving songs from. The new source will need code addition in ~mpm~
  (for resolution) and ~mpm-play~ (for playing the new source type)
+ Query improvements. These and all the frills needed for things like
  recommendations etc. will go in ~bbq~.
